# Githhub Profile Finder

In 'Github Profile Finder', we can search GitHub users by their GitHub username and we will get user's profile information.

Every time you type something (every word), the application will make a request to GitHub API looking for the typed username and respective user information matching the query will be displayed. If user not found, an alert message will be displayed.

The profile information will contain avatar, link to user's GitHub profile along with his profile information such as his repsoitories, followers and followings.
